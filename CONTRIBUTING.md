## How to Contribute

Like any good development project, we use Pull Requests (PRs) to track code changes. We recommend that if you want to contrubute and implement a fix, change, or enhancement, you do so by linking the PR with an Issue.

Depending on the access there are two ways to contribute

1. Access to the repository with write ability to create a branch. A PR will be required to merge this branch.

2. Fork the repository and create a PR to be able to link this to the parent repository and request a merge.

## Commit Messages

The commit message should state the change in 72 characters or less. Additionally we recommend, and require in some repositories, the usage of a commit lint and conventional commit so that we can map these to Release Notes.

## Versioning

We follow semantic versioning and some of our projects will use lerna to help ensure this is easy to manage.
